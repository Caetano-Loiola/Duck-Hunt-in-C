# Duck-Hunt-in-C
 
This project is intended to be a clone made in C of the classic Nintendo game 'Duck Hunt'. The library used is an adaptation of a C++ library, called CSFML. The game, however, is not complete and doesn't use the same logic mechanics of the original game, and it was made only with study purposes.

More info about the library can be found here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/
